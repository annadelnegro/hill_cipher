Language: c, c++, Java, go, python

To Compile: javac pa01.java || gcc -o pa01 pa01.c || g++ -o pa01 pa01.cpp || go build pa01.go

To Execute: java -> java pa01 kX.txt pX.txt || c++ -> ./pa01 kX.txt pX.txt || c ->  /pa01 kX.txt pX.txt || go -> ./pa01 kX.txt pX.txt || python -> python3 pa01.py kX.txt pX.txt

When: kX.txt is the keytext file && pX.txt is plaintext file

Note: All input files are simple 8 bit ASCII input
